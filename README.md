- Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI
- Nodemailer (Gmail SMTP) for emails/OTP

---

## Quick Start 🚀
### 1) Requirements
- Node.js 22+
- Firebase project
- Gmail with 2FA + App Password (for real email sending)

### 2) Environment Variables
Create `.env.local` in project root:

```
# Firebase
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=...

# Gmail SMTP (optional for dev, recommended for prod)
GMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-16-char-app-password
```

If `GMAIL_USER` and `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` are missing, OTP email falls back to console logs (dev‑friendly).

### 3) Install & Run
```
pnpm install   # or npm install / yarn
pnpm dev       # http://localhost:3000
```

> Tip: Use `pnpm build && pnpm start` for production.

## Project Structure 🗂️
```
app/
  api/send-otp/route.ts      # OTP email API (SMTP + fallback)
  surah/[id]/                # Surah detail + Mushaf view
  juz/[id]/                  # Juz detail
components/                  # UI & layout components
lib/                         # Firebase, services, contexts
public/                      # Assets (incl. night.png for dark hero)
```

## Auth & Verification Flow 🔄
1. User registers → OTP sent to email
2. OTP stored temporarily in Firestore (10‑minute expiry, 3 attempts)
3. Verification marks email as verified → reading history persists in Firestore

> In dev, OTP is printed in the console if Gmail isn’t configured.

---

## Design & Accessibility 🎛️
- Hero automatically swaps to `public/night.png` in dark mode
- Skeletons, cards, and buttons include dark variants
- Ghost buttons tuned to avoid harsh white hover in dark mode
- Arabic typography and contrast optimized for readability
